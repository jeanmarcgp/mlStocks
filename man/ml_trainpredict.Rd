\title{Train and predict a Machine Learning model}
\usage{
ml_trainpredict(train_set = NULL, valid_set = NULL, ycol = 1,
  IDinfo = NULL, mlalgo = "xgboost", mlpar = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{train_set}{The training set used for training the model}

\item{valid_set}{The validation set used to make predictions}

\item{ycol}{The name or column number where the target variable y
is found in the training and validation set.  The validation
set ycol is only used to bind the y column adjacent to yhat.
This allows for easy comparison of actual vs predicted values
in the matrix returned.}

\item{IDinfo}{This is a matrix of one or multiple columns and the same number
of rows as in the validation set.  It normally contains the date
information related to each trade, but may include other columns
such as the symbol traded, etc.  These columns are binded as
additional columns in the data frame returned.  None of this
information is used to make predictions and values do not
have to be unique (for instance, there may be multiple predictions
made on a given date). Default is NULL (no IDinfo added to
the dataframe returned).}

\item{mlalgo}{The machine learning algorithm to use during training
and prediction.  Currently supported algorithms include:
"rf", "h2o.rf", and "xgboost".}

\item{mlpar}{A list containing the parameters required by the ML algorithm
selected by mlalgo.  If NULL, then}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe with the following 3 columns and the same number of
        rows as the validation set provided.  Column 1, named "predict"
        contains the predicted value.  Column 2 contains the actual
        target value as provided by ycol in the validation set.  Column 3
        is the datecol if it was provided as an argument.  Note that datecol
        must be of same length as the validation set.
}
\description{
This is a generic function that uses the specified machine learning algorithm
to train a model from the training set.  It then makes its prediction from
a specified validation set.  It is essentially a wrapper to ease the use
of using multiple machine learning algorithms.
